			<p> Prisoners in state correctional facilities are facing significant price markups on items sold in commissaries, according to a dataset released by <em> The Appeal</em>in April.</p>

			<p>From processed food to clothing and personal religious items, some state facilities are gouging retail prices by as much as 600%, depending on existing regulations—despite prison wages being far lower than those of workers outside prison.</p>

			<p>“Work assignment” wages average between $0.12 and $1.20 an hour, depending on work performance, seniority, and industry. Federal law limits prisoners to spending a maximum of $360 at the commissary each month, combining both work assignment wages and money sent by family or friends.</p>

			<p>Prison commissary allows incarcerated people to order items from a private, monopolized retailer by filling out a form. A few days later, the items are delivered to the inmate's cell.</p>

			<p> For inmates without financial support from the outside world, some are forced to rely on food provided in the prison cafeteria and go without basic hygiene products like deodorant or shampoo. </p>

			<p>“What's provided by prisons, anywhere in any system, is never enough,” said Nick Shepack, Nevada state director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center, a nonprofit focused on alleviating financial burdens on prisoners. “You usually don't get enough toilet paper, you don't get enough toothpaste, you don't get enough soap—none of those basic items. So, you have to buy them yourself, especially if you want anything of decent quality.”</p>

			<p>Jacquin Webb, a formerly incarcerated activist with the prison reform organization Return Strong, says he was “blessed” to hold a respectable administrative job managing payroll, hiring, and accounting for prison manufacturing agencies, but he was paid just $2 an hour.

 			<p> Webb often bought beef stew packets from the commissary, choosing them over the “inedible” prison food. </p>

			<p>“If you live on just the culinary food they serve you, you're going to be in trouble. It’s all empty carbs, and there’s just not enough of it,” Webb said. “I’ve seen decently sized guys become frail and skinny because that’s what empty carbs do to you.”</p>

			<p> For Webb and other inmates, high-sodium commissary items were the only option for food with any nutritional value. However, these items were expensive, often inaccessible, and still unhealthy. </p>

			<p> “It really elevated my blood pressure,” Webb said. “Living off sodium-laden food every day— it led to the hypertension I now have.” </p>

			<p> A 4-ounce pack of Top Ramen costs about $0.40 from Keefe Group, the contracted wholesaler for Nevada state prisons. According to the Nevada Department of Corrections (DOC), that same packet of ramen is sold in the commissary for $0.67, a 67.5% markup. </p>

			<p> In 2024, projected sales of Top Ramen across Nevada’s prisons are expected to exceed 1.88 million units, generating a profit of more than $750,000 on ramen alone. </p>

			<p> Personal or religious items, such as clothing, scripture, and pendants, are also subject to price gouging, with prices varying widely from state to state. </p>

			<p> At women’s prisons, hijabs average $10, while similar hijabs retail for around $5 online through sites like the Veiled Collection. </p>

			<p> Both Keefe Group and the Nevada DOC declined requests for comment on how they set prices for wholesale and resale to inmates. However, Shepack said that profits from prison commissary items contribute to the state’s “inmate welfare fund,” which is used for programming, facility maintenance, and subsidizing prison industry wages. </p>

			<p> “Inmate welfare accounts shouldn’t even need to exist,” Shepack said. “If they do, they should be small, and incarcerated people should decide how to spend them. Unfortunately, these funds have become a way for the state to save money.” </p>

			<p> According to Webb, inmates don't see the intended benefits of the welfare fund. </p>

			<p> “We’re very deficient in programming,” Webb said. “There are maybe two programs, but they’re overcrowded and have long waitlists. People get discouraged.” </p>

			<p> Shepack attributes this lack of programming to a large portion of the welfare fund going toward prison wages and payments to private investors, leaving little for inmate programs. </p>

			<p> In battleground states like Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, and Florida, grassroots organizations such as the FFJC and Return Strong are lobbying for reforms that better serve prisoners. </p>

			<p> Before the FFJC passed legislative bill SB416, prisoners were charged for room and board in Nevada’s state prisons—a fee deducted from their monthly paychecks. The bill eliminated fees for room and board, and the FFJC also pushed for regulations to eliminate price markups on hygiene items, some of which had reached 66%. However, markups on food and other personal items remain. </p>

			<p> “As long as prisons are responsible for raising revenue to pay for themselves, you're going to see high commissary prices,” Shepack said. </p>

			<p> For Webb, improving prison food quality and offering better programming are key to reducing reliance on commissary items. </p> 

			<p> “The biggest issue is that people aren’t aware of what’s going on,” Webb said. “It’s about making society aware of the truth of what’s happening in prisons and getting them to say, ‘Hey, this is a problem.’” </p>
